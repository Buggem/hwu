# Building it

## C

We recomend GNU C Compiler for this program

Simply `cd` into the folder with the main code and then execute this command to compile the C code.

```
gcc test.c -o test.exe
```

### Windows

Type in the command `test` that we just built. Then it'll execute and (if we have done everything right) say "Hello World!".

### Linux

Execute binary executable by doing the following command.

```
./test.exe
```

## Java

First execute:

```
javac test.java
```
There will be a class file exported.
Then execute:

```
java test
```

## Anything else

These other special languages can be simply executed straight out of the box.
Open HTML or PHP with Chrome. Use <script src="test.js"></script> in any HTML file to use JavaScript.
`./test.sh` in the terminal for Bash and just open the .bat in Windows for Batch.
See? It's easy!
